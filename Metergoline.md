Product Details

This chemical metergoline is a very interesting substance and is a continuation of my search for chemicals that combine several beneficial characteristics into a single molecule/entity. Metergoline belongs to the same class of drugs as bromocriptine, lisuride, cabergoline, terguride, etc. However, unlike them **it is an antagonist at the serotonin receptors 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. Most ergot drugs are agonists on those receptors with the possible (and partial) exception of lisuride. More importantly, just like lisuride metergoline is an antagonist at the dreaded 5-HT2B receptor. This may endow it with anti-fibrotic properties similar to lisuride, terguride, ritanserin and cyproheptadine**. In addition, unlike other serotonin antagonist that simply block serotonin receptors metergoline is actually capable of also reducing serotonin synthesis. The putative dopamine agonism is probably responsible at least partially for this effect. Furthermore, metergoline has been shown to lower prolactin in humans and animal models, with effectiveness similar to bromocriptine when used in the same doses. Preliminary research suggests that **metergoline is an agonist at the D2 receptor**, which is not surprising given its similarity to lisuride, bromocriptine, etc. However, its exact dopamine receptor agonism profile is not well-known. What is even more interesting is that metergoline is capable of lowering prolactin through a (currently unknown) non-dopaminergic mechanism. So, it represents a viable alternative with less risk for dopamine receptor downregulation.

Some other interesting properties (according to the published studies) include ability to lower cortisol in doses as low as 2mg daily, improve insulin sensitivity in animal models, and act as an antidepressant.

Finally, metergoline possesses activity against the Candida strain of fungi and especially the potentially lethal strain Candida krusei, which typically kills 50% - 60% of the people it infects and is naturally resistant to antifungals like fluconazole. As far as I know, metergoline is unique among all ergot derivatives in its anti-fungal properties.

"...Summary: **A dopamine agonist and serotonin antagonist.**It has been used similarly to BROMOCRIPTINE as a dopamine agonist and also for MIGRAINE DISORDERS therapy."

Metergoline is a non-selective serotonin antagonist and putative dopamine agonist. As a serotonin antagonist it targets the 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors but due to its general antiserotonin effects it is considered a non-specific serotonin antagonist similar to cyproheptadine. The dopamine agonism profile of metergoline is not well-known except some evidence for D2 receptor agonism. Metergoline is capable of lowering prolactin through both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic mechanisms and displays similar effectiveness to bromocriptine in the same dose range, and the two drugs are considered synergistic. One of the most interesting properties of metergoline is its antifungal activity against Candida strains, which are naturally resistant to anti-fungal drugs.

"...**As metergoline acts predominantly as a serotonin antagonist it might be expected to have additive or synergistic effects when combiend with bromocriptine. Although it has some dopaminergic activity, this is probably not the mechanism that suppressed prolactin. Interestingly, the prolactin concentration in one patient was reduced further when 2.5mg bromocriptine was added to treatment**...Metergoline provides satisfactory treatment for many patients unable to tolerate bromocriptine and should beuseful in the management of hyperprolactinaemia either alone or combined with a small dose of bromocriptine."
