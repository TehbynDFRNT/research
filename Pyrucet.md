Product Details

As many forum users know, I have been interested in the Randle Cycle (glucose/fat competition for oxidation) for quite some time. The topic of limiting fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and promoting glucose oxidation is pretty central to the metabolic theory of health. Peat has written many times on that topic and has mentioned numerous chemicals that can improve glucose oxidation, as well as reduce (excessive) FAO. Niacinamide, aspirin, and vitamin E are probably the ones most commonly mentioned in his wrings and interviews and we have had many discussions about them on the forum. However, all of these substances do not really inhibit FAO directly. That simply limit (excessive) lipolysis. There are chemicals out there that do inhibit FAO directly and perhaps the most well known one is Mildronate (Meldodium). Other ones include trimetazidine, etomoxir, ranolazine, etc. Unfortunately, with the exception of Mildronate all other clinically used FAO have severe side effects, which greatly limit their use.

So, I spend a lot of time over the last year looking for chemicals that work similarly to Mildronate but without toxic side effects. It turns out that there are not many other such chemicals, and the ones that I found could not really be developed into a topical product due to their skin irritating effects. However, as I was reading some of Peat's old articles and newsletter I stumbled upon two naturally present chemicals that seemed very promising as pro-metabolic substances. One of them was pyruvate and the other one was acetoacetate. Both are technically ketones. Pyruvate is the ketoacid of the amino acid alanine, and acetoacetate is the ketone version of the fatty acid butyrate. Both are used as biomarkers of the redox status in the form of tests for pyruvate/lactate ratio and acetoacetate/3β-hydroxybutyrate ratio. As I kept digging, it turned out that both chemicals are not only indicators of redox status but also modulators of it - i.e. administration of either one of these shifts the redox balance in favor of oxidation. As a result, the more familiar NAD/NADH and GSSG/GSH ratios also rise. The former needs no introduction, but the latter is extremely important in cancer. Cancer cells accumulate massive amounts of GSH and they use it to protect themselves from the ROS generated by chemotherapy. In fact, the high GSH levels is considered the primary factor in "chemotherapy resistance" and Big Pharma has spend a lot of money on trying to identify chemicals that can deplete GSH. Well, as one of the studies in the references section below shows, administering high dose **acetoacetate for just one day dropped GSH levels to zero**, while a more moderate dose (available in our product) also dropped GSH levels down to zero after 3-4 days of administration. As it turns out, pyruvate is also capable of such effects GSH-depleting effects. **But perhaps the most intriguing effects discovered for both pyruvate and acetoacetate is their ability to inhibit FAO**. Both substances show FAO inhibition of at least 50% in concentrations easily achievable with a single dose in the range provided by our product. While the exact mechanism of action for FAO inhibition of both chemicals is not really known, one older study found that pyruvate works similarly to the known FAO etomoxir. In addition, subsequent studies demonstrated that **both pyruvate and acetoacetate stimulate the activity of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)**, which is the limiting step in the oxidation of glucose. Low activity of PDH has been demonstrated in virtually all chronic diseases, especially diabetes, cancer, dementias, liver disease, kidney disease, CVD, etc. We have numerous threads on this forum discussing studies on downregulated PDH in various diseases and ways to increase its activity. The (in)famous drug dichloroacetate (DCA) is not much different structurally from acetoacetate and its primary mechanism of action is inhibition of of PDK and thus re-activation of PDH. Big Pharma is well-aware of the benefits of activating PDH and has several drugs being tested on animals to see whether activating PDH can treat "non-metabolic" conditions like dementias, muscular dystrophies, and even ALS. They have not tried PDH activation for cancer yet (aside from unofficial studies with DCA) but all the evidence points to PDH being a huge factor in cancer treatment as well.

Now, the problem with pyruvate is that it is unstable in solution and also has to be administered in really high doses in order to exert its beneficial effects. The human studies typically use 15g-50g pyruvate daily. Acetoacetate is also unstable, but at least lower doses still have powerful oxidizing and pro-glucose oxidation effects. As it turns out, the research community was aware of the potential of pyruvate as far back as the 1970s and tried to find an alternative to plain pyruvate that would have all of the benefits but would be stable and would produce benefits at much more reasonable doses. And they found it! As it turns out, the ester known as **ethyl pyruvate (EP)** is highly stable at a wide range of temperatures and when mixed with other chemicals. It is also more lipohilic than plain pyruvate and this is the proposed explanation behind EP's ability to exert the same beneficial effects in doses up to two orders of magnitude (100-fold) lower than plain pyruvate. In addition, a number of studies comparing EP and plain pyruvate demonstrated robust benefit with EP but no benefit from pyruvate. Several studies (listed below) tried to discover the reason for the differential effects between EP and pyruvate, and as it turned out EP's effects are unique and not shared by either ethanol or pyruvate when administered together as separate chemicals. Similarly, **ethyl acetoacetate (EC)** was also found to be stable and have similarly beneficial effects to the non-esterified version. We already use EC as one of the solvents for several of our products. It is listed on the label as FEMA 2415, which is its food-additive designation, but I had no idea it had so many other beneficial effects. While the research with EC is sparse, the research with EP seems to have really taken off over the last 30 years as can be seen from the studies in the references section below. Some of the more notable benefits of EP include powerful and broad spectrum anti-inflammatory, preventing ATP decline and energetic dysfunction in a wide variety of acute and chronic conditions, anti-bacterial/anti-viral/anti-fungal, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, cardioprotective, anti-cancer, anti-septic and endotoxin blocker, immunoprotective, gonadoprotective, thymoprotective, etc. The list goes on and on and on and the amount of research on EP is just staggering. I am both surprised and not that we have not heard anything on mainstream media about this very promising endogenous metabolite. Given the plethora of studies on its benefits across such a wide variety of conditions, I can only assume its generic nature and unpatentability are to blame for it being completely unknown in the clinical world.

So, that's pretty much it. The stable lipophilic esters of two endogenous metabolites are apparently capable of a wide gamut of beneficial effects while having virtually no known side effects (at least in the doses used in the studies below). In fact, **both EC and EP have been designated by the FDA as "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) and are widely used as food-flavoring additives**. However, the amounts needed for the beneficial effects seen in studies are much bigger than what can be obtained from food. The typical doses of both EC and EP used in rodent studies were 40mg/kg daily. The HED of that protocol is about 6.5mg/kg daily.

As far as the name - it is a combination of the words **pyru** vate and a **cet** oacetate.

Pyrucet is a combination of the ethyl esters of the endogenous metabolites/ketones pyruvate and acetoacetate. Numerous studies have demonstrated that those ethyl esters are more stable and more lipophilic than their unesterified versions. A large number of studies have examined the effects of ethyl pyruvate (EP) and ethyl acetoacetate (EC) on issues ranging from glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, redox status, inflammation, autoimmunity, kidney, heart, liver, brain, thymus, spleen, joint, etc health and most of those studies call for urgent human trials considering the robust benefits displayed by these chemicals in animal models.

[Inhibition of free fatty acid oxidation by acetoacetate in normal dogs. - PubMed - NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5497217) (EA)

“…The rate of turnover and oxidation of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) waa measured in 7 normal anaesthetized dogs infused at a constant rate with 1-W-palmitate for 5 h. After a control period, sustained hyperketonaemia was induced by **infusing sodium aceto-acetate (AA). This produced a fall in plasma FFA (33%) and in blood sugar (24%)**, without changes in immuno-reactive insulin (IRI) concentrations. During the control period, the turnover rate of carbon of **FFA** averaged 131 uat.C/kg/min, 32% of which were oxidized, thus **supplying 17.7% of the total CO, production**. **At the end of the AA infusion**, the mean turnover rate of FFA was reduced to 75 uat. C/kg/min; since **only 13.9% of these were oxidized, the contribution of FFA to total CO, production was reduced to 4.3%** .”

“…About **75% of the fatty acids removed were oxidized to carbon dioxide accounting**, at this concentration of fatty acids in the perfusate, **for** **37% of oxygen consumption of the heart**… **In the presence of 10mM pyruvate or acetoacetate, the uptake of fatty acids from the medium was reduced approximately 50% and the oxidation of the extracted acids was reduced further so that only 25% of the fatty acids oxidized by the control group appeared as carbon dioxide** in the presence of competing substrate… **The competing substrates**, thus, contributed 75%-85% to the fuel of the respiration and **reduced the contribution of the fatty acids to 8%-9% of the total respiration of the heart**…It may be of considerable interest to examine the **competition between pyruvate and free fatty acid** over a range of concentrations bracketing physiological concentrations of both substances… **Both acetoacetate and pyruvate** can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle without resort to a kinase, and this may be one reason why they **compete successfully with fatty acids** which require the action of adenosine triphosphate and a thiokinase.”

[Inhibition of palmitoylcarnitine oxidation by pyruvate in rat heart mitochondria. - PubMed - NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3999980) (P)

“…The oxidation of 1 -‘4C-palmitoylcarnitine by rat heart mitochondria has bean measured by assessing both the disappearance of substrata and the appearance of labelled products. **Pyruvate inhibited palmitoylcarnitine oxidation by about 40%. Fifty percent inhibition occurred at about 20 umol/L pyruvate**. The inhibitory effect of pyruvate required entry of pyruvate into mitochondria since it did not occur in the presence of a-cyano4hydroxycinnamic acid, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter. “

“…Earlier work by Olson and by Evans et al had demonstrated **significant inhibition (40% to 50%) of palmitate oxidation in the retrogradely perfused heart by** lactate and by **pyruvate**. In addition, experiments by Harris et al5 and by Hirche and Langor have shown that lactate could compete effectively with fatty acids for oxidation by the heart in vivo. These observations have led us to investigate the possible inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by pyruvate in isolated rat heart mitochondria. **We have demonstrated a significant inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by pyruvate**.”

[Fatty acid accumulation during ischemia and reperfusion: effects of pyruvate and POCA, a carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor. - PubMed - NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1811059) (P)

“…During reperfusion, however, the tissue FA level dramatically increases, indicating that **the inhibitory effects of pyruvate and POCA on FA utilization are additive**. **Pyruvate is known to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase and, hence, to stimulate its own conversion to acetyl-CoA** (Kobayashi and Neely, 1983). **As a consequence, the availability of mitochondrial free CoA will be diminished and beta-oxidation becomes inhibited** (Brosnan and Reid, 1985). In this manner pyruvate probably inhibits the removal of FAs released from endogenous lipid pools during reperfusion.”

“…In summary, the present findings show that POCA and **pyruvate markedly increase the FA content of reperfused hearts, most likely through inhibition of the oxidation of FAs** released from endogenous lipid pools.”

“… **Production of two other proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF, and NO was suppressed by EP** in macrophages and microglia. Reactive oxygen species production in macrophages, microglia activation, and the development of Ag-presenting phenotype in microglia and macrophages were constrained by EP. The release of IL-6 was reduced in astrocytes. Finally, EP inhibited the activation of transcription factor NF-κB in microglia and astrocytes. Most of these effects were also found for DMF, implying that EP and DMF share common targets and mechanisms of action. Importantly, EP had in vivo impact on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. **Treatment with EP resulted in delay and shortening of the first relapse, and lower clinical scores, whereas the second attack was annihilated**. Further studies on the possibility to use EP as an MS therapeutic are warranted.”

“…Our results speak in favor of this possibility. **Maybe the most favorable facts are that EP** reduced IFN-γ and IL-17 generation in human PBMCs, alleviated EAE in rats, and even more it **practically prevented the second relapse**.”

“…However, when cortical neurons were exposed to acute treatment of Zn(2+) (400 μM, 15 min), **EP, but not pyruvate, significantly suppressed neuronal death**, despite the fact that NAD replenishment by EP was weaker than that by pyruvate. Spectrophotometric studies revealed that EP directly chelates Zn(2+), and this was confirmed in physiological contexts, such as, NMDA-treated primary cortical cultures and OGD-subjected hippocampal slice cultures, in which EP suppressed intracellular Zn(2+) elevation and neuronal cell death. In addition, EP markedly reduced the expressions of PARP-1 and of the NADPH oxidase subunit in Zn(2+)-treated primary cortical neurons, well known Zn(2+)-induced downstream processes. Together, these results show **EP suppresses Zn(2+) induced neurotoxicity via dual functions, chelating Zn(2+) and promoting NAD replenishment**.”\

[Ethyl Pyruvate: An Anti-Microbial Agent that Selectively Targets Pathobionts and Biofilms. - PubMed - NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27658257) (EP)\
\
“…The microbiota has a strong influence on health and disease in humans. A causative shift favoring pathobionts is strongly linked to diseases. Therefore, anti-microbial agents selectively targeting potential pathogens as well as their biofilms are urgently demanded. Here we demonstrate the impact of ethyl pyruvate, so far known as ROS scavenger and anti-inflammatory agent, on planktonic microbes and biofilms. **Ethyl pyruvate combats preferably the growth of pathobionts belonging to bacteria and fungi independent of the genera and prevailing drug resistance. Surprisingly, this anti-microbial agent preserves symbionts like Lactobacillus species. Moreover, ethyl pyruvate prevents the formation of biofilms and promotes matured biofilms dissolution. This potentially new anti-microbial and anti-biofilm agent could have a tremendous positive impact on human**, veterinary medicine and technical industry as well.”\
