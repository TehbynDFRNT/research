Product Details

I am pleased to announce the release of Tyronene - a pure T3 products dissolved in SFA esters and ethanol. It contains the same total amount of T3 per bottle as other popular liquid T3 products on the market, sold by other chemical vendors. However, the bottle we use is only half as big so the amount of solvent used to dissolve the T3 is less. This makes the product twice as concentrated. There is no need for references on this product, so in this thread I am just providing the basic information on the ingredients and concentration per drop.

The units listed on the label are just for measurement purposes. They do not indicate or suggest optimal dose. Please note that similar to the liquid products sold by companies like Sigma Aldrich, Spectrum Chemical, Alfa Aesar, etc, this product if for lab/research use only.

Triiodothyronine is the active thyroid hormone. It is synthesized from T4 and some other thyroid percursors, primarily in the liver. It affects almost every physiological process in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate.

Each drop contains the following ingredients:

Liothyronine (T3) sodium, USP: 8 mcg
