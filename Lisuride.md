Product Details

After many months of often fruitless searching and negotiations with chemical vendors from all over the world, I am pleased to finally announce the release of our Lisuride product. This is perhaps the most anticipated product we have ever released and it is for a good reason. The recent acquisition of terguride (lisuride, with just a single extra H atom) by Pfizer with the intent of treating heart, liver, lung, and other fibrosis demonstrates the commitment of Big Pharma to the correct idea that serotonin is a causative factor in the pathology of so many conditions. It is not a "happy hormone" at all, unless you consider a zombified, fibrotic state to be a form of bliss. Lisuride is one of the most potent dopamine agonists currently in clinical or research use. It is active across most known dopamine receptors (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5). In addition, it is an antagonist on several serotonin receptors such as 5-HT2B, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. The systemic effects of lisuride have been described in studies as both dopaminergic and anti-serotonergic. It is the antagonism of 5-HT2B that makes lisuride and its cousin terguride interesting for various fibrotic conditions. It is also worth noting, that lisuride is one of the few known so-called "inactivating" antagonists on the serotonin receptors 5-HT6 and 5-HT7.

[5-HT7 receptor - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HT7_receptor#Inactivating_antagonists)

An inactivaing antagonist renders a receptor persistently unable to react to an agonist such as serotonin or a serotonergic drug. This is similar to the effects of "suicidal" aromatase inhibitors like exemestane, which permanently deactivate the aromatase enzyme. These properties of lisuride suggest that it can have a very long-term serotonin antagonistic effects on specific receptors, and even a single dose can manifest its effects long after the lisuride is excreted from the body. This makes lisuride able to achieve beneficial effects even with very infrequent dosing, which has been confirmed in clinical trials at least in regards to lowering prolactin.

[Lisuride - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisuride)

"...Lisuride is used to lower [prolactin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin) and, in low doses, to prevent [migraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine) attacks. The use of lisuride as initial anti-Parkinsonian treatment has been advocated, delaying the need for [levodopa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levodopa) until lisuride becomes insufficient for controlling the parkinsonian disability. **Preliminary trials suggest the [dermal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermis) application of lisuride may be useful in the treatment of [Parkinson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease). As lisuride is very poorly absorbed when take orally and has a short half-life, continuous transdermal administration offers significant advantages and could make the compound a far more consistent therapeutic**. Lisuride is not currently available in the US, as the drug was not a commercial success in comparison with other dopamine receptor agonist antiparkinsonian compounds."

The units listed on the label are just for measurement purposes. They do not indicate or suggest optimal dose. Please note that similar to the liquid products sold by companies like Sigma Aldrich, Spectrum Chemical, Alfa Aesar, etc, this product if for lab/research use only.

Lisuride is a chemical agent of the iso-ergoline class, related to the dopaminergic ergoline Parkinson's drugs. Lisuride is a full dopamine and a mixed agonist/antagonist for several serotonin receptors. It is an antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, which is its main mechanism of action in reversing fibrosis of various tissues and organs. It has a high affinity for the dopamine D2, D3 and D4 receptors, as well as D1, and D5. It is an agonist of 5-HT1Aand 5-HT2C receptors, and putative antagonist on 5-HT2A (which explains its antagonism to LSD hallucinogenic effects). Lisuride is also a putative histamine antagonist, on both H1 and H2 receptors.

Drops per container: about 240

Each drop contains the following ingredients:

Lisuride (maleate): 25 mcg

Other ingredients: add product to shopping cart to see info

Note: **Liquid preparations of lisuride are best kept at a temp of 20 degrees C or lower to ensure shelf-life of at least 3 months**.
